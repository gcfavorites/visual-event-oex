Visual Event extension is advanced tool to develop reach web applications. It provides information of events attached to DOM-elements on HTML-page. Visual Event shows:

  * Which elements have events attached to them
  * The type of events attached to an element
  * The code that will be run with the event is triggered
  * The source file and line number for where the attached function was defined

Simply click on extension button on toolbar and you’ll see all elements with attached events highlighted. Move cursor to highlighted event and you’ll see JavaScript code that will be called when event triggered.

If you want to disable debug mode just click on extension button once more.
